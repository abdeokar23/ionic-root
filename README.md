Integrating Ionic and Loopback
------------------------------

If you have not created the REST API already, which will be required for this app, go to: https://github.com/abdeokar23/ionic-loopback-integration

This app was created with reference from: https://www.joshmorony.com/building-a-review-app-with-ionic-2-mongodb-node/

The only difference being, the REST API was created using Loopback Framework for simplicity.

Changes to the app design can be made with reference from the Ionic documentation. Ionic allows app design for Android, iOS and Windows Phone.
