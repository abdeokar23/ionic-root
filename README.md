Integrating Ionic and Loopback
------------------------------

If you have not created the REST API already, which will be required for this app, go to: https://github.com/abdeokar23/ionic-loopback-integration

This app was created with reference from: https://www.joshmorony.com/building-a-review-app-with-ionic-2-mongodb-node/

The only difference being, the REST API was created using Loopback Framework for simplicity.

Changes to the app design can be made with reference from the Ionic documentation. Ionic allows app design for Android, iOS and Windows Phone.

The app does not yet run flawlessly. For running the app, type the commands below in the terminal from the ionicApp folder:

	ionic serve

	or

	ionic lab

On running the app, click on View Devices button first. Then continue with Add Device. Initially the app will not work without clicking on View Devices first, the issue is being worked on.
